# CfdOF: A Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workbench for FreeCAD

This workbench aims to help users set up and run CFD analyses within the [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org)
modeller. It guides the user in selecting the relevant physics, 
specifying the material properties, generating a mesh, assigning boundary conditions and choosing the solver settings
before running the simulation. Best practices are specified to maximise the stability of the solvers.

The workbench serves as a front-end to the popular OpenFOAM® CFD toolkit (www.openfoam.org, www.openfoam.com).

This offering is not approved or endorsed by OpenCFD Limited, producer and distributor of the OpenFOAM software via www.openfoam.com, and owner of the OPENFOAM® and OpenCFD® trade marks

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

The CfdOF workbench depends on the following external software, some of
which can be automatically installed (see below for instructions).

- [Latest release version of FreeCAD (at least version 0.18.4 / git commit 16146)](https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php)
 or [latest development version (0.19 prerelease)](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases)  
- OpenFOAM [Foundation versions 5-8](http://openfoam.org/download/) or [ESI-OpenCFD versions 1706-2012](http://openfoam.com/download)  
- [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/)  
- [FreeCAD plot workbench](https://github.com/FreeCAD/freecad.plot.git)
- [cfMesh (customised version updated to compile with latest OpenFOAM versions)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cfmesh-cfdof/)
- [HiSA (High Speed Aerodynamic Solver)](https://hisa.gitlab.io)
- [GMSH (version 2.13 or later)](http://gmsh.info/) - optional, for generating tetrahedral meshes

### Setting up the CfdOF workbench

#### Windows

The latest 
[release](https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php) 
or [development](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases)
FreeCAD build can be obtained (64 bit version) and installed
by respectively running the installer or extracting the .7z archive to a directory
<FreeCAD-directory>. In the latter case, FreeCAD can be run in place
(<FreeCAD-directory>\bin\FreeCAD.exe). 

Before installing CfdOF, the Plot workbench must first be 
installed into FreeCAD using the Addon manager:

* Run FreeCAD
* Select Tools | Addon manager ...
* Select Plot in the list of workbenches, and click "Install/update"
* Restart FreeCAD
* Repeat the above for the "CfdOF" workbench
* For installation of dependencies, see below

Note: The CFD workbench can be updated at any time through the Addon manager.

##### Dependency installation

Dependencies can be checked and installed
conveniently from the CfdOF Preferences panel in FreeCAD.
In the FreeCAD window, select Edit | Preferences ... and
choose "CfdOF". 

The OpenFOAM installation is via the [OpenCFD MinGW package](https://www.openfoam.com/download/install-binary-windows-mingw.php).
The [OpenCFD docker package](https://www.openfoam.com/download/install-binary-windows.php) as
well as the [BlueCFD Core](http://bluecfd.github.io/Core/) port are also currently supported but have some issues.  

OpenFOAM can be installed manually using the above link, or by clicking the relevant
button in the Preferences panel described above. If you experience problems running OpenFOAM in CfdOF, please make
sure you have a working installation.

Set the OpenFOAM install directory in the preferences
panel to the install directory ending in the 'vXXXX' subfolder (where XXXX is the version number installed).
 It will be automatically detected in the default install
location.

Any version of [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/) can be installed, 
by following the above link or clicking the relevant button in the Preferences panel.
Set the ParaView install path in the preferences panel to the 'paraview.exe' file in the 'bin' 
subfolder of the ParaView installation. Common defaults will be detected if it is left blank.

Likewise, cfMesh and HiSA can be installed from the 
Preferences panel. Do not close the
it until the 'Install completed' message is received.
Note that the OpenFOAM installation must be in a writable location
for cfMesh and HiSA to be installed successfully.

Choosing the "Check dependencies" option will verify that all 
prerequisites have been successfully installed.

#### Linux

AppImages of the latest [release](https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php) 
or [development](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases) 
versions of FreeCAD can be downloaded and run directly
without installation. Note that you will
have to enable execution permission on the downloaded file to run it.
The [Ubuntu PPA daily build](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Install_on_Unix)
packages are an alternative binary option. Otherwise, FreeCAD can be built 
from the source code at 
https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD . 

Before installing CfdOF, the Plot workbench must first be 
installed into FreeCAD using the Addon manager:

* Run FreeCAD 
* Select Tools | Addon manager ...
* Select Plot in the list of workbenches, and click "Install/update"
* Restart FreeCAD
* Repeat the above for the "CfdOF" workbench
* For installation of dependencies, see below


##### Dependency installation

Dependencies can be checked and some of them installed
conveniently from the CFD Preferences panel in FreeCAD.
In the FreeCAD window, select Edit | Preferences ... and
choose "CFD".

However, in Linux, manual installation is required for 
OpenFOAM ([OpenCFD](https://openfoam.com/download) or [Foundation](https://openfoam.org/download/) versions),
[Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/) and
[GMSH](http://gmsh.info/) (optional). They should be
installed using your distribution's package manager
or the links above. 

Set the OpenFOAM install directory in the preferences
panel - examples of typical install locations are /opt/openfoam7 
or /home/user/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-7.x (It will be automatically 
detected in common default install
locations.) Note that if you have loaded the desired OpenFOAM 
environment already, the installation path must be left blank
to use this.
This also applies in the case of the Debian OpenFOAM package which is integrated into
the system.  

cfMesh and HiSA can be installed using the Preferences panel described above,
and can be downloaded and built from their source
code inside your OpenFOAM installation if you have
not already done so yourself. Note that this is a lengthy process.

Choosing the "Check dependencies" option will verify that all 
prerequisites have been successfully installed.

## Development
[![Total alerts](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/alerts/g/jaheyns/CfdOF.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/jaheyns/CfdOF/alerts/)[![Language grade: Python](https://img.shields.io/lgtm/grade/python/g/jaheyns/CfdOF.svg?logo=lgtm&logoWidth=18)](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/jaheyns/CfdOF/context:python)

It is asked that developers should only add functionality or code that is working and can be tested. Dead code, even
portions included for possible future functionality, reduces function clarity and increases the maintenance overhead. 
Our philosophy is 'Do the basics well' and therefore robust operation takes precedence over extended functionality.

### Testing

Unit testing is currently under development. Where possible, it is asked that all new functionality should be included
in the unit test framework.


### Style guide

For consistency please follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
1. Use 4 spaces per indentation level (spaces are preferred over tabs).
2. Limit all lines to a maximum of 120 characters.
3. Break lines before binary operators.
4. Blank lines 
    
    - Surround top-level function and class definitions with two lines.

    - Definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single line.
    
5. Imports should usually be on separate lines.
6. Comments
    - Docstrings always use """triple double-quotes"""
    
    - Block comment starts with a # and a single space and are indented to the same level as that code
    
    - Use inline comments sparingly. They are on the same line as a statement and should be separated by at least two
 spaces from the statement. 

7. Avoid trailing whitespaces
8. Naming convention

    - ClassNames (Camel)
    - variable_names_without_capitals (Underscore)
    - CONSTANTS_USE_CAPITALS (Uppercase)
    - functions_without_capitals (underscore, preferred as it follows PEP8)
    - functionsWithoutCapitals (Camel instead of underscore is accepted as it is widely used within FreeCAD)
    - __class_attribute (Double leading underscore)
